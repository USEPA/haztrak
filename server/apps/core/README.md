# Core Django App

The Core django 'app' is responsible for resources and cross-cutting concerns that
are used by all other django apps such as authentication, authorization, and the
RcrainfoService class.

See our documentation's [chapter on terminology](https://usepa.github.io/haztrak/terminology.html).
