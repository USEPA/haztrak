# Sites Django App

The Sites django 'app' is responsible for resources related to the
US Environmental Protection Agency's (EAP) concept of a Hazardous Waste Site.

We would have gone with 'site' as the name but there's already a 'site' package in
the python std library.

See our documentation's [chapter on terminology](https://usepa.github.io/haztrak/terminology.html).
