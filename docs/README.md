## Deploying Haztrak
- If you're reading this, you probably want to give haztrak a try or you're looking to setup a local
development environment. Haztrak comes with these built-in options...
    ### Docker-compose
    - The easiest way to deploy on your local workstation is to use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
        - The terminal is expected to include the same [environment variables](./Configuration.md) as the other options
    ### Runhaz.sh
    - haztrak also comes with a convenience shell script, [runhaz.sh](/runhaz.sh)
        - It includes options to make [Django migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/migrations/), and load data from [fixture files](/server/tests/fixtures)
        - `$ runhaz.sh -h` to see usage.
    ### Deploy the individual containers
    - Deploy the containers yourself, [client](/client/Dockerfile), and [server](/server/Dockerfile).
        - Again, [environment variables expected](/docs/Configuration.md)
        - Maybe we'll include helm charts in the future.
    ### Deploying locally
    - Run locally for development without containerization, note this only runs the
Django Restful API and the React SPA. If Haztrak moves to a more complicated structure that requires other services
such as [Redis](https://redis.io/) and/or [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery), those will need to be deployed separately.
    - This has the added benefit that both Django and React local development servers hot swap development changes
        - Setup Python environment
            1. Cd into server, create a virtual environment, and activate
                ```shell
                $ cd ./server && python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate # should be .venv/scripts/activate on windows
                ```
            2. Install the django development dependencies
                ```shell
                $ pip install -r requirement_dev.txt
                ```
            3. Configure you're environment, either with a local `/server/.env` file or environment variables directly.
            4. If you're not using an existing database, make Django's migrations and run then
                ```shell
                $ python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
                ```
               or use runhaz.sh
                ```shell
                $ cd .. && ./runhaz.sh -m # this make and run all django migrations
                ```
            5. Run Django's development server
                ```shell
                $ python manage.py runserver
                ```
               or use runhaz.sh
                ```shell
                $ cd .. && ./runhaz.sh -r # this will run both the client and server
                ```

        - Setup React
            1. Open a separate terminal and install dependencies
                ```shell
                $ cd ./client && npm install .
                ```
            2. Start the local development server
                ```shell
                $ npm run start
                ```
## Configuration
Haztrak expects it's configuration in the form of environment variables. See our [Configuration Docs](/docs/Configuration.md)

## Contributing
You are cordially invited to contribute to haztrak. Please see our [guide on how to contribute](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
## Code of Conduct
We love your feedback, we just ask that you do it constructively. Contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Demo Code
As a demo application, Haztrak contains code that is, intentionally, not meant for production (i.e., code that shows off features while deployed locally). If anyone ever imagines doing something with this source, they should probably adjust this parts.

All demo code is marked with comments beginning with `Begin HT demo` and `End HT demo`. The Demo code will often only run if the [REACT_APP_HT_ENV](./Configuration.md#client) environment varible is set to `local`
```typescript
// Begin HT demo
// Brief Explanation
someDemoFn()
// commented out ProdFn()
// End HT demo

```
