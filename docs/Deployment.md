# Deploying Haztrak

Below is a list of built in options for deploying Haztrak yourself. Primarily, we focus on setting
up a development environment.

### Docker-compose

- The easiest way to deploy on your local workstation is to
  use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
    - You can either export Haztrak's expected [environment variables](./Configuration.md) to
      the terminal before deploying or use [config files](/configs)

```shell
$ docker-compose --env-file configs/.env.dev -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up --build
```

- The [docker-compose.dev.yaml](/docker-compose.dev.yaml) is an override file. It runs the React
  client and Django server as mounted volumes that allow for the app to be hot reloaded after
  change, in
  addition to the other services expected by the server.
- It also loads fixtures to the configured database on start, namely 2 users which can be used for
  development purposes.
    1. username: testuser1, password: password1
    2. username: admin, password: password1
       The admin user has superuser privileges and can also login to
       the [django admin portal](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/admin/).

### Deploy the individual containers

- Build and deploy the containers yourself, [client](/client/Dockerfile),
  and [server](/server/Dockerfile).
    - [environment variables expected](/docs/Configuration.md)
    - Maybe we'll include helm charts in the future.

### NPM and Django scripts

If you don't have a way to build and run containers, or you're a gluten for punishment, you can
make use of the scripts exposed by django and create-react-app.

#### Pre-requisites

- Python >= 3.8
- Node.js (along with a node package manager like yarn or npm)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)

  Haztrak also uses [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery), which can be installed though PyPi,
  and will need to be deployed separately.

    - Setup Python environment
        1. Cd into server, create a virtual environment, and activate
            ```shell
            $ cd ./server && python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate # should be .venv/scripts/activate on windows
            ```
        2. Install the server and celery dependencies
            ```shell
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
            ```
        3. Configure you're environment, either with a local `/server/.env` file or environment
           variables directly in the terminal used to deploy the server.
        4. If you're not using an existing database, make Django's migrations and run then
            ```shell
            $ python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
            ```
           or use runhaz.sh
            ```shell
            $ cd .. && ./runhaz.sh -m # this will make and run all django migrations
            ```
        5. Run Django's development server
            ```shell
            $ python manage.py runserver
            ```
           or use runhaz.sh
            ```shell
            $ cd .. && ./runhaz.sh -r # this will run both the client and server
            ```

    - Setup React
        1. Open a separate terminal and install dependencies
            ```shell
            $ cd ./client && npm install .
            ```
        2. Configure with an .env in [client/.env](/docs/Configuration.md), or ensure your terminal
           has the appropriate variables.
        3. Start the local development server
            ```shell
            $ npm run start
            ```
        4. Please note, currently, the react client will not be able to authenticate without a
           server and you will not be able to make it past the login page unless you run the haztrak
           server locally in a container or through django's built in runserver command.

### Runhaz.sh

- haztrak also comes with a convenience shell script, [runhaz.sh](/runhaz.sh) which wraps around
  create-react-app and django's commands.
    - It includes options to
      make [Django migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/migrations/), and
      load data from [fixture files](/server/fixtures)
    - `$ runhaz.sh -h` to see usage.
