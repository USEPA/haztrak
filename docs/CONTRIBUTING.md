### Setting up a development environment

* To make life a little easier, we've included a couple configs to help get a
  development environment setup.
* `.editorconfig`
    * Universal IDE configs for formatting files, most IDEs will have a plugin you can
      install

* pre-commit
    * [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks are set to run a number
      of linting and formatting checks before commits on any branch is
      accepted.
    * Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) on your workstation
    * In the root directory, run `$ pre-commit install`
        * Alternatively, `$ ./runhaz.sh -p` will install and run the hooks

* `runhaz.sh`
    * A bash script to help with development
    * See usage with `$ ./runhaz.sh -h`

* `Prettier`
    * [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used to autoformat source files, specifically
      the
      front end for now. If you're using an IDE, it likely have a prettier plugin
      available.
    * The configs are found in [.prettierrc.json](/client/.prettierrc.json)
      and [.prettierignore](/client/.prettierignore)
