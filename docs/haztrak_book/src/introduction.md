# Haztrak

Haztrak is, for lack of a better term, a proof of concept (POC) project that aims to illustrate how third party system can leverage the resources exposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's IT systems, [RCRAInfo](https://rcrainfo.epa.gov) and [e-Manifest](https://github.com/USEPA/e-manifest). More specifically, how these resources can be leveraged to electronically manifest [hazardous waste](https://www.epa.gov/hw) shipments to ensure proper management from cradle-to-grave instead of the manual and paper intensive process that has been in place since the 1980's.

Keep in mind that Haztrak is labor of love, there's aspects of Haztrak that will likely never be ready for a production deployment. Our entire budget is our spare time.
