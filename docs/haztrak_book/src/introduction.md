Haztrak is, for lack of a better term, a proof of concept (POC) project that
illustrates how third party system can leverage the resources exposed by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's IT systems, [RCRAInfo](https://rcrainfo.epa.gov)
and [e-Manifest](https://github.com/USEPA/e-manifest). More specifically, how
these resources can be leveraged to electronically manifest
[hazardous waste](https://www.epa.gov/hw) shipments to ensure proper management
from cradle-to-grave instead of the manual and paper intensive process that has
been in place since the 1980's.
