# Haztrak

Haztrak is an example web-application that aims to illustrate
how [hazardous waste](https://www.epa.gov/hw) management software can interface with and
leverage
the resources exposed by EPA's [RCRAInfo](https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/)
and [e-Manifest](https://github.com/USEPA/e-manifest) systems.
