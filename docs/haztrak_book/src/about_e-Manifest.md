# About e-Manifest

June 30, 2018. EPA launched a national system for tracking hazardous waste shipments
electronically, this system, known as "[e-Manifest](https://www.epa.gov/e-manifest),"
modernizes the nationâ€™s paper-intensive process for tracking hazardous waste from cradle
to grave while saving valuable time, resources, and dollars for industry and states.

e-Manifest, a modular component of [RCRAInfo](https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/), can be
accessed by
its users a few ways...

1. Through their favorite web browser at https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/
2. Via the RCRAInfo RESTful application programming interface (API)

Haztrak aims to showcase how hazardous waste handlers can utilize the latter in their
own waste management software. In Particular, using electronic manifest without the need
to log into RCRAInfo through a browser.

This project would not be possible without the work of the EPA e-Manifest Team.

## e-Manifest Background

If you're looking for background information on the e-Manifest Program, you can find
uptodate information on the [United States Environmental Protection Agency's e-Manifest
page](https://www.epa.gov/e-manifest).

The e-Manifest and RCRAInfo team also communicates changes to the e-Manifest system
with biweekly virtual user calls
and [monthly webinars](https://www.epa.gov/e-manifest/monthly-webinars-about-hazardous-waste-electronic-manifest-e-manifest).
Links to the biweekly user call can be obtained by subscribing
via [govdelivery](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEPAORCR/subscriber/new).

## e-Manifest Documentation

The e-Manifest team maintains a public git repository on GitHub
at [USEPA/e-Manifest](https://github.com/USEPA/e-manifest) that contains
documentation on the RCRAInfo web services, as well as
the [emanifest](https://pypi.org/project/emanifest/) python
library to help use the RCRAInfo web services.

## RCRAInfo Pre-Production Environment

The RCRAInfo (and by extension e-Manifest) team make the pre-production
environment available for user testing and development. In order to develop and test
much of Haztrak's RCRAInfo-facing functionality, you will need an account with API
credentials to this environment and the appropriate permissions for sites you would
like to use for testing purposes.

For information on how to access the RCRAInfo preprod environment, see
the [e-Manifest How to Participate](https://www.epa.gov/e-manifest/how-participate-testing-hazardous-waste-electronic-manifest-system-e-manifest)
page. You can find information on the RCRAInfo user roles in the [e-Manifest FAQs
here](https://www.epa.gov/e-manifest/frequent-questions-about-e-manifest#user_question6).
