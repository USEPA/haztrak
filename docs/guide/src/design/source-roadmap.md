# Source Roadmap

We know that finding your way around a new codebase can be tough.
This chapter will get you acquainted with the project and repository structure.

## Notable Directories

### Server

Notable directories for server development and source control

#### The Django Apps

[`server/apps`](https://github.com/USEPA/haztrak/tree/main/server/apps/)
This directory houses all our Django apps (Django refers to each one of these as an 'app', not to be confused with the smallest deployable unit which is a 'project', a project uses many apps). On many Django projects the apps would be in the root of the project, we keep them in 'apps' for organizational purposes.

Each app constitutes a vertical slice through our back end system.

#### The Core App

[`server/apps/core`](https://github.com/USEPA/haztrak/tree/main/server/apps/core)
This app contains our user model, authentication, and things that a used by many other apps.
Future work will remove unnecessary dependencies on this app from other apps.

#### The Site App

[`server/apps/site`](https://github.com/USEPA/haztrak/tree/main/server/apps/site)
This app contains the `TrakSite` model, views, and logic. A `TrakSite` is a location that where EPA regulated activity occurs. Haztrak only supports working with regulated activities that fall under regulations promulgated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), but theoretically, a `TrakSite` could also correspond to a location where other environmental regulated activities occur such as Clean Air Act (CAA) or Clean Water Act (CWA) regulated activities.

#### The RCRASite App

[`server/apps/rcrasite`](https://github.com/USEPA/haztrak/tree/main/server/apps/rcrasite)
This app contains the `RcraSite` models. A `RcraSite` is a location that is known to the EPA's RCRAInfo system.

#### The Org App

[`server/apps/org`](https://github.com/USEPA/haztrak/tree/main/server/apps/rcrasite)
This app contains the `TrakOrg` (short for "Trak Organization") model, views, and logic. A `TrakOrg` is an organization allows Haztrak to tie together users and sites. An Org is managed by one or more admins, admins can control RBAC to `TrakSite`s for the organization's users. EPA's RCRAInfo system does not have a concept of an organization.

### Client

Notable directories for client development and source control

#### Client Features

[`client/src/features`](https://github.com/USEPA/haztrak/tree/main/client/src/features)
This directory, contains our features. Features consume [components](#client-components) the redux store slices. Generally, features map to routes the user can take. A feature component only relies on global state/context and does not accept any props.

#### Client Components

[`client/src/components`](https://github.com/USEPA/haztrak/tree/main/client/src/components)
This directory contains basic components that act as building blocks for features. Ideally, components should be 'dumb', only consuming props and not relying on global state/context, however we have not been strict about this.

Components should be organized by concept, not by role (i.e., don't put all buttons in a `Button` directory). The hierarchy of our component dependencies should generally follow a tree structure. For example, if a `MyManifest` component depends on a `ManifestGeneralDetails` component, the `ManifestGeneralDetails` be in the same directory or a subdirectory of the `MyManifest` component. The corollary to this is the `UI` directory, which contains components that do not contain any logic, and are used by any component in the application.
