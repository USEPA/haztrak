# Testing

The Haztrak project uses a combination of manual and automated testing to ensure that the application is
thoroughly tested.

Contributors are encouraged to practice [test driven development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), we
often ask that contributors provide tests to prove their PR are acting as intended.

## Testing the Server

The test suite for each [Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial07/)
is located in the `tests` directory of each app.

test files are ignored during the [container build](../development/cd.md#2-docker-build) process.

The following links provide a good overview of testing within the Django, and DRF, ecosystems.

- [DRF Testing](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/)
- [Django Testing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/testing/)

### Pytest and Fixtures

To get started writing test for the server, you will need to be familiar with
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/).

As part of the effort to reduce test maintenance cost, the haztrak project has developed a series of
abstract factories as fixture. They are located in the `conftest.py` files, which allows them to be
dependency injected into the test suite when requested by name.

For an introduction to using pytest fixtures to test django, see the following articles:

### Running Server Tests

The client test suite can be run following these steps.

1. set up your development environment, (e.g., clone the repo, setup a virtual environment)

   - Clone the repo
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Activate the virtual environment
   - Download the dependencies

2. Run the tests

   - To run all the test

   ```shell
   pytest
   ```

   - To run a specific test file or directory, just include the path to the test file or directory

   ```shell
   pytest path/to/test.py
   ```

## Testing the React Client

The Haztrak client employs an automated test suite with unit and integration tests to ensure the client is
reliable and bug-free. These tests should be run locally by developers to ensure
recent changes don't introduce errors as well during the [CI process](../development/ci-cd.md).

Tests are stored in `*.spec.{ts,tsx}` files alongside the corresponding source file.
These files are ignored (not included) during the container build process.

### Running Client Tests

The client test suite can be run following these steps.

1. Setup the dev environment

   - Clone the repo
   - Change into the client directory
   - Download the dependencies

2. configure the environment

   ```shell
   cp ../configs/.env.test ./.env
   ```

3. Run Tests

   ```shell
   npm test
   ```
