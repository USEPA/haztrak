# About e-Manifest

June 30, 2018. the [United States Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov) (USEPA or EPA)
launched a national system for tracking hazardous waste shipments
electronically, this system, known as "[e-Manifest](https://www.epa.gov/e-manifest),"
modernizes the nationâ€™s paper-intensive process for tracking hazardous waste from cradle
to grave while saving valuable time, resources, and dollars for industry and states.

e-Manifest is a modular component of [RCRAInfo](https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/) which can be
accessed by its users in two ways:

1. Through their favorite web browser at https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/
2. Via the RCRAInfo RESTful application programming interface (API)

Haztrak aims to serve as a reference implementation for how hazardous waste handlers can utilize the latter in their own waste management software.

This project would not be possible without the work of the EPA e-Manifest Team.
