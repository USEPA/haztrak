Please keep in mind that Haztrak is intended to be an example application. That means, for the time being, some security
vulnerabilities may be
intentionally overlooked to avoid unnecessary complication. However, if you feel that a vulnerability should nto be
ignored or you believe you have found one
that we may have overlooked, please report it.

Thank you.
