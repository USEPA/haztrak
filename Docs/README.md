1. Configurations files that are automatically generated by django, such as the database, installed apps
2. The home of all django apps
2b. currently, Haztrak host the web app and the APIs. The api app contains serializers that allow other apps to consume the RCRAInfo/third party APIs. It leans on models defined other apps.
2d. This is just for sites that the users manages. Logic for handlers listed on manifests is found in the trak app
2e. Views for all things manfiests related
3. Lib stores all logic that is shared between apps. If you find yourself writing things more than once, it should probably go here. For example, the rcrainfo package contains all logic for conusuming the RCRAInfo APIs
4. Pretty self explanitory, static files such as images, css. Also any javascript goes in here. 
5. Non-app specific templates, such as base.html and the 404 page. 
6. The documentation you're reading right now.
