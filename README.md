# Haztrak :recycle:

Haztrak is a web application that aims to illustrate
how [hazardous waste](https://www.epa.gov/hw) management software can interface with
EPA's [e-Manifest](https://github.com/USEPA/e-manifest) systems to track hazardous waste electronically from
cradle-to-grave.

If you like the work we do, star this repo for greater visibility.

### About e-Manifest

June 30, 2018. the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched a national system for tracking hazardous waste shipments electronically,
this system, known as "[e-Manifest](https://www.epa.gov/e-manifest)," modernizes the nationâ€™s paper-intensive process
for tracking hazardous waste from cradle to grave while saving valuable time, resources, and dollars for industry and
states.

e-Manifest, a modular component of [RCRAInfo](https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/), can be accessed by its users in two ways:

1. Through your favorite web browser at https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/
2. Via the RCRAInfo RESTful application programming interface (API)

Haztrak aims to showcase how hazardous waste handlers can utilize the latter in their own waste management software.
In Particular, using electronic manifest without the need to log into RCRAInfo through a browser.

For more information on using the RCRAInfo and e-Manifest web services, please see the
[USEPA/e-Manifest](https://github.com/USEPA/e-manifest) repo or contact the
[e-Manifest Team](https://www.epa.gov/e-manifest/forms/contact-us-about-hazardous-waste-electronic-manifest-system).
