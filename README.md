# Haztrak :recycle:

Haztrak is a example web-application that aims to showcase
how [hazardous waste](https://www.epa.gov/hw) management software can interface with and leverage
the resources exposed by EPA's [RCRAInfo](https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/)
and [e-Manifest](https://github.com/USEPA/e-manifest) systems.

### About e-Manifest

June 30, 2018. EPA launched a national system for tracking hazardous waste shipments electronically,
this system, known as "[e-Manifest](https://www.epa.gov/e-manifest)," modernizes the nationâ€™s
paper-intensive process
for tracking hazardous waste from cradle to grave while saving valuable time, resources, and dollars
for industry and states.

e-Manifest, a modular component of [RCRAInfo](https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/), can be accessed by
it's users a few ways...

1. Through your favorite web browser at https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/
2. Via the RCRAInfo RESTful application programming interface (API)

Haztrak aims to showcase how hazardous waste handlers can utilize the later in their own waste
management software.
In Particular, using electronic manifest without the need to log into RCRAInfo through a browser.

For more information on using the RCRAInfo and e-Manifest web services, please see the
[USEPA/e-Manifest](https://github.com/USEPA/e-manifest) repo or contact the
[e-Manifest Team](https://www.epa.gov/e-manifest/forms/contact-us-about-hazardous-waste-electronic-manifest-system)
.
This project would not be possible without the work of the EPA e-Manifest Team.

## Getting Started :rocket:

- looking to try haztrak or setup a local development
  environment? [See our documentation on built-in options to deploy](docs/README.md#deploying-haztrak)

Looking to contribute?

- For a high level overview of the project components, configuration, diagrams, see
  our [documentation](https://github.com/USEPA/haztrak/tree/main/docs).
- See the [guide on submit a PR](https://github.com/USEPA/haztrak/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [Report an issue, request a feature, or find something to work on](https://github.com/USEPA/haztrak/issues)
  .
    - Just starting out? We try to keep
      the [Good First Issue](https://github.com/USEPA/haztrak/labels/good%20first%20issue) label up
      to date

## Documentation :page_facing_up:

See the READMEs in the [server](server/README.md) and [client](client/README.md) directories for a
high level
overview.

We plan on additional developer documentation in the [docs](./docs) directory, which contain
theoretical workflows for using the RCRAInfo services.

Lastly, since this is intended to be first and foremost an example web application,
we will work to keep a healthy dose of inline comments in the codebase.

## Development Status :warning:

those seeking
a working example with the technical expertise to leverage the source for their own requirements.
