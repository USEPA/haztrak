# haztrak
haztrak is a simple web application that aims to showcase how hazardous waste handlers can integrate their systems with EPA's RCRAInfo and e-Manifest system.

### The end goal is to create something that users can...
1. See a functioning example in action
    - see the instruction on spinning up a local example
3. Read and easily understand how it functions
    - Haztrak was written to be read with plenty of comments in the source code, also see our documentation
5. Extend and make thier own
    - Haztrak is distributed under the a permissive license. Feel free to take, adapt and redistribute it!

### Haztrak is not...
1. An out-of-the-box solution
    - Haztrak is not meant for end consumers, those looking to use haztrak should have the necesarily knowledge and skills to deploy such a web application on their own. 
3. distributed with warranty of any kind
    - We welcome bug report, issues, patches, etc. However, you should not adopt haztrak with the expectation of recieving support from it's developers.
